  title 'A private web server must be located on a separate controlled access subnet.'
  desc 'Private web servers, which host sites that serve controlled access data, must be protected from outside threats in addition to insider threats. Insider threat may be accidental or intentional but, in either case, can cause a disruption in service of the web server. To protect the private web server from these threats, it must be located on a separate controlled access subnet and must not be a part of the public DMZ that houses the public web servers. It also cannot be located inside the enclave as part of the local general population LAN.'
